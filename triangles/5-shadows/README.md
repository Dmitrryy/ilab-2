# LVL 5 'reflections and shadows': 

## task description

The meshes you generate are useful in that they can cast shadows and give reflections.

Your task is to generate a simple scene: in the middle there is a large mirror ball standing motionless on a hard floor

Above the floor around the ball, the generated meshes fly, rotating, (you can start with one) and each is reflected in the ball and casts a shadow on the floor

Two or three light sources should be located on top, the sources can be made configurable
